# Group Alert
Group Alert enables ownCloud's admin users to display a message on several files's view for defined groups. It allows to choose in which shared folder's view the message will be displayed.
# Installation
Place this app in **owncloud/apps/**
# FAQ
Why do i not see my folders in the folder selection field ?
    Group-alert works only for shared folders (folders you share with and folder shared from others) to ensure the file's tree is respected.
    However you can see the "file's main view" by default because all user account have got it.
# Usage
type your message in the text area, select for which groups and in which shared folder you want to display it and activate or deactivate it with the Enable/Disable button.
